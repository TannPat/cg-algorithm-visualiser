# Computer Graphics Algorithm Visualiser

This project is an interactive visualiser for foundational computer graphics algorithms. It focuses on mathematical derivation, decision variables, and pixel-level changes.
Emphasis lies on step-by-step reasoning over rote memorisation.

In many computer graphics courses, rasterisation algorithms are taught as set-in-stone steps to be memorised, with little emphasis on how they were formulated or why they work.
This project aims to bridge that gap by linking derivations, algorithmic decisions, and visual outcomes in an interactive, cohesive format.

## Core Features (Planned)
- Synchronised tabs for derivation, algorithm, and visualisation.
- Step-by-step execution with explicit updates to decision variables.
- Pixel-level visualisation of algorithm behaviour.
- Cross-linked variables between mathematical expressions and code logic.

## Status
This project is currently in early development.
